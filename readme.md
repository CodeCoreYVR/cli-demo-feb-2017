#Stuff in here again

Here are few things you can do to complete your computer's setup.

XCode (for Mac users)
Make sure to have XCode installed from the app store. Then complete the installation by running the following command in terminal: xcode-select --install.


I am super user! ðŸ’ª

Atom
Install Shell Commands from the main menu as in this screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jbzn9nzzf2f64jw/Screenshot%202016-01-10%2012.19.20.png?dl=0
Enable "autosave": It's a fairly common mistake that developers forget to save a file and wonder why changes aren't reflected. Atom has a feature to automatically save your changes. Go to Atom > Preferences then search for "autosave" then click on "Settings" and make sure that it's enabled as in this screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ot6ri0soz3vzwlf/Screenshot%202016-01-10%2012.20.18.png?dl=0
Keyboard
We will be using the Command Line a lot so it's good to have the speed of keyboard key repeat fast and make the delay short. In Mac you can change those by going to System Preferences > Keyboard and change the settings as in this photo: https://www.dropbox.com/s/62j6mj0zdcfga75/Screenshot%202016-01-10%2012.27.04.png?dl=0

Coloring Your IRB
We will be using Ruby a lot and it's good to have IRB colored. You can set it up by opening your .irbrc file in atom by running the command atom ~/.irbrc in Terminal and then add the following content to the file: https://gist.github.com/tkbeili/11119985. After that run the following command to install the required gems: gem install awesome_print interactive_editor hirb. Ask a TA for help if you run into an issue.

RVM
Make sure you have RVM installed and have the latest Ruby installed for tomorrow's lesson. Follow the instructions here: https://rvm.io/rvm/install. Start by running the following command: curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
